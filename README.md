This is a proxy for [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/), which makes it possible to debug incoming and outgoing packets and even modify them.

## Features
- [x] Print incoming and outgoing packets (text, variant list, etc).
- [x] Support for [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/) 3.92 and up.
- [x] Built-in http server with metadata from [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/) server data.
- [x] Works well with sub-server redirection.
- [ ] Command.
- [x] Config file.
- [ ] Pathfinding for auto collect, etc.
- [ ] Loading items' database (items.dat) will request one from [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/).
- [ ] Local Player & Remote player.
- [ ] Auto puzzle captcha solver.

## Supported platform
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). Tested with Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11.
- [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html). Tested with Ubuntu and Arch Linux. (but who use GNU/Linux to play growtopia?)

## Known issue
- Client disconnected after updating items.dat.
- [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/) crash because larger items.dat? (usually private servers that don't use zlib compression)
- Spoofing login info which causes the server to think that your [Growtopia](https://growtopiagame.com/) version is old.

## Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
- [Conan, the C/C++ Package Manager](https://conan.io).

## Building the source
1. First you need to clone the source code of this project. `git clone https://github.com/ZTzTopia/GTProxy.git`
2. Install Python 3.5+ (Windows only: select 'Add Python to PATH' in installer)
3. CMake will install needed package with [Conan, the C/C++ Package Manager](https://conan.io). `pip install conan`
```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
$ cmake --build .
```

## Running the program
- If you on Windows, you need move needed dynamic binary from `/path/to/binary/conan/bin` to `/path/to/program/`.
- Run the program.
- Edit the `config.json` file.
- Run the program again.
- Enjoy.
